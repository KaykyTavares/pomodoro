# 1. Introduction
This is a project to create a :tomato: **`pomodoro`** :tomato: web app. I'm devoloping the **`first version`** but the **`main ideia`** is **`improving`** the project in parallel **`with my skills`** or lear with others that want collaborate. So, It will be a long project :laughing:.  

# 2. Run project locally
This project was developed to run in **`Docker`**:whale:.
So, you **`must have`** the Docker properly installed in your machine:computer:. After that, follow the steps:

1. Clone the repository
    ``` bash
    git clone git@github.com:KaykyTavares/pomodoro.git
    ```
2. Change to app folder
    ``` bash

3. Now, just execute the following command:
